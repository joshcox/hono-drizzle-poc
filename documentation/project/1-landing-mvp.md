### **User Story Strategy and Notes:**

Before finalizing the user stories, it's essential to outline a strategic approach to ensure clarity, minimize context switching, and maintain efficiency during implementation. Here's a strategic breakdown:

1. **Cross-Cutting Components:**  
   Many sections across the pages utilize similar components (e.g., `card`, `hero`, `grid`, `steps`). Implement these components first to establish a consistent structure.
  
2. **Content Reuse:**  
   - The content about the farm's history and values appears in both the Home and About pages, which can be developed simultaneously.
   - The “How to Purchase” process will influence both the FAQ and Contact pages, ensuring consistent communication.

3. **Progressive Disclosure:**  
   Build the site in a way that allows for the most critical sections (like the Home and About pages) to be fully functional first, followed by more detailed pages (Our Cattle, Purchasing Guide, Contact).

### **Questions Before Finalizing:**
1. **Content Details:**
   - Should the testimonials be hardcoded, or do we expect to update them periodically?
   - What specific points should be highlighted in the "Mission & Values" section?

2. **Visual Style:**
   - Are there specific color schemes or fonts that need to be adhered to?

3. **Imagery:**
   - Confirm the availability of high-quality images for the hero sections, cattle gallery, and family photos.
